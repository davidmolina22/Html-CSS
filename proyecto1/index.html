        <h3 id="headline">History of User story</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>1997</strong> - Kent Beck introduces user stories at the
            Chrysler C3 project in Detroit.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1998</strong> - Alistair Cockburn visited the C3 project and
            coined the phrase "A user story is a promise for a conversation."
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1999</strong> - Kent Beck published the first edition of the
            book Extreme Programming Explained, introducing Extreme Programming
            (XP), and the usage of user stories in the planning game.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2001</strong> - Ron Jeffries proposed a "Three Cs" formula
            for user story creation:
            <ul>
              <li>
                The Card (or often a post-it note) is a tangible physical token
                to hold the concepts
              </li>
              <li>
                The Conversation is between the stakeholders (customers, users,
                developers, testers, etc.). It is verbal and often supplemented
                by documentation
              </li>
              <li>
                The Confirmation ensures that the objectives of the conversation
                have been reached.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2001</strong> - The XP team at Connextra in London devised
            the user story format and shared examples with others.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2004</strong> - Mike Cohn generalized the principles of user
            stories beyond the usage of cards in his book User Stories Applied:
            For Agile Software Development that is now considered the standard
            reference for the topic according to Martin Fowler. Cohn names
            Rachel Davies as the inventor of user stories. While Davies was a
            team member at Connextra she credits the team as a whole with the
            invention.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2014</strong> - After a first article in 2005 and a blog
            post in 2008, in 2014 Jeff Patton published the user-story mapping
            technique, which intends to improve with a systematic approach the
            identification of user stories and to structure the stories to give
            better visibility to their interdependence
